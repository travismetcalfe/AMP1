Programme for computing structure kernels.
=========================================

The programme was developed by Mike Thompson (see Gough & Thompson, 1991;
`The inversion problem'.  In Solar interior and atmosphere,
eds Cox, A. N., Livingston, W. C. & Matthews, M., p. 519 -- 561,
Space Science Series, University of Arizona Press.) The programme
allows computation of kernels for a wide variety of model-difference
pairs:

 1.  Eulerian ln(c^2) and ln(rho)
 2.  Eulerian ln(Gamma1) and ln(rho)
 3.  Eulerian ln(c^2) and ln(Gamma1)
 4.  Eulerian ln(u) and ln(Gamma1)
 5.  Eulerian ln(u) and Y
 6.  Eulerian ln(rho) and Y
 7.  Eulerian ln(c) and ln(Gamma1/c)
11.  Lagrangian ln(c^2) and ln(rho)
12.  Lagrangian ln(Gamma1) and ln(rho)
13.  Lagrangian ln(c^2) and ln(Gamma1)
14.  Lagrangian ln(u) and ln(Gamma1)
17.  Lagrangian ln(c) and ln(Gamma1/c)

It requires the model on amdl form, possibly (for kernels involving the
equation of state) thermodynamic derivatives (output from the evolution
code on unit iddgm1 when set; files typically named dgam1...), and
eigenfunctions on the density-scaled form, as output from the pulsation
code with nfmode = 3.

The basic use of the code is through the command

run-strker <input> <output>

where <input> is the file of input parameters, as usual with active lines
indicated by ending in @. 

A template input file is provided in ../bin/rin/strker.rin, and a sample
script using this (with parameter substitution) is in ../bin/run.strker.
