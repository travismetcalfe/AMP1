Controls of unit numbers:
========================

Hardcoded numbers:

Unit numbers used in Houdek opacity initialization:

Reserve units 61 - 98 for hardcoded diagnostics units.

Currently the following are used:

75: Diagnostics from s/r varfrq (controlled by idgn75)

76: Diagnostics from boundary condition routines (controlled by idgn76)

77, 87: Diagnostics from s/r rhs (controlled by idgn77)

91: General scratch input/output
