c   
c  redistributes mesh in physical model 
c   
c  modified 9/1/1985 to allow use of central expansion to reset 
c  points in new model interior to first non-zero point in old  
c  model. old expansion may still be used by setting ioldex = 1.
c   
c  modified 17/5/1985. now interpolates in x**(-2)*aa(i,n)  
c  for i = 2 and 4 (these tend to a constant at x = 0), 
c  and sets aa(2,n) interior to first mesh point in original
c  model from expansion of p and other aa-s.
c   
c  modified 21/5/1985 in treatment of convection zone boundary  
c  (see s/r stcvzb) 
c   
c  modified 21/5/1985 to include contribution in stretching 
c  from superadiabatic gradient, to ensure adequate resolution very 
c  near surface.
c   
c  modified 29/3 - 1/4 1989 to include various fixes for stretching
c  polytropic model
c
c  modified 30/5/92, to include term in change in buoyancy frequency,
c  and smoothing with running mean.
c
c  modified 25/7/92, to smooth A4 near centre, particularly 
c  near hydrogen exhaustion
c
c  modified 17/2/98, to allow reading general-format amdl files
c  (including aa(6,.), say)
c
c  Modified 5/7/01, fixing criterion for discontinuity in rho, now
c  based on aa(4,.). This is, for the time being, flagged by a
c  negative ndisc. The old criterion is obtained by selecting
c  a posive ndisc.
c
c  Modified 28/1/02, adding contribution from cx at x = 0.
c
c  Modified 9/6/03, adding term to A(4,.)/x**2 in g-mode term to correct 
c  for under-resolution in very compact convective cores.
c
c  Modified 10/6/03, changing treatment of region near density
c  discontinuity.
c  Also test and possibly correct behaviour of A(1,.) at central
c  point. (Note that expansion in evolution code requires checking
c  with 4He burning!)
c
c  Modified 16/2/05, fixing the new definition of the boundaries
c  of a discontinuity region (applied when ndisc .lt. 0)
c
c  Modified 9/3/05, introducing option to ensure a minimum fraction of
c  points in p-mode region, flagged by cg lt 0.
c
c  Major modification 6/7/05, separating bulk of code into a
c  subroutine for later integration with evolution package.
c
c  Modified 7/3/08, using iresa4 = -1 to reset data(6)
c
c  Modified 22/9/08, introducing test of monotonicity of xsi after vinta
c  integration in s/r srdist, with s/r test_mono. If xsi is not monotonic, 
c  xsi is reset on relevant interval with trapezoidal integration.

c  Input parameters (read from s/r srdist):
c
c  nn: number of points in new mesh

c  Default: icnmsh=0  
c  icase: for icase = 1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 21, 22, 23, 24 set standard parameters.
c     icase = 1, 2, 3 give old parameters, as used up until June 1988.
c     icase = 11 gives new, optimized p mode parameters
c     icase = 1  corresponds to p modes, old parameters
c     icase = 2  corresponds to g modes, old parameters
c     icase = 3  corresponds to intermediate modes, old parameters.
c     icase = 11 corresponds to p modes, new parameters.
c     icase = 12 corresponds to g modes, new parameters.
c  Revision 3/5/10, including cg .lt. 0 (see below).
c  For icase .ge. 20, set new standard nsmth, ndisc, dlxdsc
c     icase = 21  corresponds to p modes, revised parameters
c     icase = 22  corresponds to g modes, revised parameters
c     icase = 23  corresponds to intermediate modes, revised parameters.
c     icase = 24  corresponds to modes in red giants
c
c  Note that cg .lt. 0 is used to flag for ensuring that a reasonable
c  fraction of points correspond to p modes (fraction hardcoded in
c  call of s/r testcg).
c  Default: icase=0   
c  icvzbn: for icvzbn .gt. 0 ensure that there is a mesh point at   
c     the lower boundary of the convective envelope.
c     for icvzbn = 1 interpolate normally in aa(i,.) for i .ne. 4,   
c     and reset aa(4,.) by linear interpolation near boundary.

c     boundary.

c     running mean over nsmth points

c     discontinuity in rho
c     NOTE: ndisc lt 0 selects for new (post-05/07/01) criterion

c  cdg: weight for gradient in A in interior of model
c     if cdg .gt.0, limit contribution (before scaling by cdg)
