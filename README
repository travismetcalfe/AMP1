Complete package of the Aarhus evolution code
=============================================

Installation instructions:

1) Change directory to the desired root <evolroot> of the package.

2) Do 
   tar xvf <pack_dir>/evolpack-tma.tar
   where <pack_dir> is the directory where the tar file is kept.

3) Change directory to <evolroot>/prg

4) Do
   setups [-C <compiler>] (a)
   (This changes various absolute directory names to refer to the chosen
   path).
   Follow the instructions concerning the setting up of paths and
   environment variables.
   
5) Do (still in directory <evolroot>/prg)
   make all

6) Add  <evolroot>/bin to command search path

7) Add  <evolroot>/idl_pro to IDL_PATH

8) Add 
   setenv eprgdir = <evolroot> 
   to .cshrc file

Notes:

(a) The argument to setups allows a choice of Fortran compiler. This is
    carried by suitable editing of the Makefile templates (with a
    rudimentary option of resetting FFLAGS also). The default is f77.
    Calling
    setups -help
    provides a summary of usage.
    Note also that setup checks for the presence of templates and only
    resets those cases, for which a template is provided. Since the
    templates are deleted as part of the setup, this allows a new setup
    if a revised template is provided.
